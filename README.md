# KeyScope

## Quick Start

1.  Run `keyscope.py`.

2.  If you get a popup window telling you that System Events is trying to unlock Universal Access preferences, enter your password.  You won't get this window if you have already enabled access for assistive devices in your System Preferences.  This must be enabled for KeyScope to sniff your keyboard.

3.  After `keyscope.py' prints `starting...', go to [`http://localhost:8000/`](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

4.  Do normal activities.  KeyScope will track your key presses even when you're using other windows and other applications.
